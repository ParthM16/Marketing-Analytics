# Objective:

Data: I've attached the .bak file</br>
Data Description:
  - Data from 2023 to 2025</br>
  - It contains customer details, customer reviews, product details, customer engagement data, and customer journey


# What I've Learnt
</br>

## 1. Data Cleaning in SQL Server


### **Product Table**
- Introduce a new `category` column based on the `Price` column.
- Categorize products into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** price ranges.

### **Customer Table**
- Enhance customer details by performing a join operation with the `Geography` table.

### **Customer Engagement Table**
- Derive two new columns from a single source for better data segmentation.
- Standardize text columns to ensure consistency.

### **Customer Journey Table**
- Remove duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- Handle `NULL` values effectively.

### **Customer Review Table**
- Clean up text data using the `TRIM` function to remove unnecessary whitespace.

</br>


## 2. Sentiment Analysis using Python

### **Database Connection & Data Retrieval**
- Connects to an SQL Server database using `pyodbc` to fetch customer review data.

### **Sentiment Analysis**
- Utilizes **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) to compute a compound sentiment score for each review.
  - Sentiment score ranges from **-1** (most negative) to **+1** (most positive).

### **Sentiment Categorization**
- Combines the sentiment score with the customer rating to classify reviews into the following categories:
  - **Positive**
  - **Negative**
  - **Mixed Positive**
  - **Mixed Negative**
  - **Neutral**

### **Data Export**
- Saves the processed data, including sentiment scores and categories, to a CSV file for further analysis.

# Conclusion

- Enhanced marketing effectiveness for an online retailer by identifying the `top 3` product categories with `high conversion 
rates` but 32%-42% `non-positive` review sentiment across 3 years of data using `SQL` (data cleaning), `Python` (review sentiment analysis), and `Power BI` (built dashboard). </br>

- Presented `two data-driven` strategies:
  - A shift in content focus from blog (historically dominant) to video and social media 
  - A targeted campaign to convert non-positive reviews to positive ones for high-conversion productsâ€”to optimize marketing spending and improve product ratings.
